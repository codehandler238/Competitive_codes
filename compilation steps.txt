compilation steps-
1)-preprocssing take place(The preprocessor is a separate program in reality, but it is invoked automatically by the compiler.)
2)-code is converted into assembly language(intermediate human redable)
3)-code is then converted into machine code or object code(binary)
4)-linking(libraries are linked and various other object code segments are linked)

assembler-translate assembly code into machine code

cc test.c
object code is generated and saved into file name a.out,we can change the file name by
cc -o file_name test.c
